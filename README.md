# Hangout prototype gadget for Ubuntu Online Summit presentation

This gadget is supposed to harmonize and ease how we launch hangouts for Ubuntu Online Summit:
* set topics, invite interested guests
* show harmonized starts and end screens of the show with music
* feed back data to http://summit.ubuntu.com so that presenter doesn't have to copy and paste hangout and live feed url.
